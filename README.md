# Network-Simulation-and-VLAN-Management
This project demonstrates the design and management of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) in a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. VLANs enhance network security and performance by segregating traffic based on roles or departments, with inter-VLAN routing enabling communication between VLANs.
